# Text Encryption Project

This project aims to convert plain text into ciphertext using four different ciphering methods: Caesar Shift, Playfair Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, and one additional method.

## About

The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective tool for encrypting plain text messages using various classical encryption techniques. Each cipher method offers a different level of security and complexity.

## Cipher Methods

### 1. Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. It's one of the simplest encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar who reportedly used it to encrypt his messages.

### 2. Playfair Cipher

The Playfair Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that employs a 5x5 grid of letters for encryption. It encrypts pairs of letters at a time, creating digraphs, and uses various rules to handle specific scenarios.

### 3. Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère Cipher is a form of polyalphabetic substitution that uses a keyword and a tabula recta (a square table) to encrypt and decrypt messages. The keyword determines the shift for each letter in the plaintext, offering stronger encryption than simple substitution ciphers.

### 4. Shift Cipher

A Shift Cipher, also known as a Caesar Cipher, is a basic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. It operates by replacing each letter with the letter that appears a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet.
